# E-Mat-Test

Swapnil's Project


## Steps to Run Project

1. Install Ganache and create a Workspace.
2. Install the npm package truffle globally i.e. ```npm i truffle -g```.
3. Run ```npm i``` to install all the packages.
4. In ```truffle-config.js``` file, replace 'from' address to any address from the workspace. That address will be the owner of the contract.
5. In the terminal run ```truffle migrate --reset```. This will compile and deploy your smart contract from ```contracts``` folder.
6. Run a test by typing the command ```truffle test <filename>``` in the terminal.
7. Then, run ```npm start```.
8. I have made a route for testing the contract created by me for testing(Addition of 2 numbers). You can open <a href="http://localhost:3000/testing">http://localhost:3000/testing</a> in the browser to view the result.
